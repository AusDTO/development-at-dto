## Readme

Include a README in your repo. [Read the guide](https://changelog.com/a-beginners-guide-to-creating-a-readme/) and start with [the template](https://github.com/Goochie/gch-github-README)

## Meaningful commit messages

> A well-cared for log is a beautiful and useful thing.

* Separate subject from body with a blank line
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters
* Capitalise the subject line
* Do not end the subject line with a period
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line
* Wrap the body at 72 characters
* Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

## Creating pull requests

Pull requests should have a meaningful title and description, this allows whoever is taking care of your pull requests to do so with ease.

A basic template is outlined [here](../github/templates/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

## Git workflows

Every project is different and every team should decide on their own [Git workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows). If your project structure demands it, consider a [gitflow branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
