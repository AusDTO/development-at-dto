Welcome to the DTO handbook.

We want to capture and communicate our values, our culture, our practices, and our knowledge through this handbook.

In capturing all of this knowledge, we have this approach to structuring our knowledge:
* Who we are and what we do
* Our culture and values
* How we work and how we'll succeed
* Getting started on your first day
* Making the most of your DTO working experience

Ultimately, this is a tech community-driven product to celebrate and show case how well we work together.

We're looking forward to your contributions.
